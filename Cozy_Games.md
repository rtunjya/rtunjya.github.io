## The Rise of Cozy Video Games During the Pandemic Years: Documentation
### Jay Gujral | PROG 102: Code

**Overview**

This project is a website that demonstrates through data visualization the rise in popularity of cozy video games- specfiically Stardew Valley, Among Us and Animal Crossing. I attempt to analyze why this boom happened by cross-referencing the user-interest peaks with online reviews and my own personal experiences.

**Information Display**

This website displays the information I found in my research by first showing the peaks in user interest (data sourced from Wikipedia), the distribution of consoles used to play these games and information on the three video games like developer name, release date and summary (data sourced from RAWG).
