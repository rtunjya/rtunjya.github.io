This project is a website that briefly shows some ways in which algorithms are being used in the music industry today. 

 
**Information Display**

This website displays the information I found in my research in the format of cards. These cards reference specific articles and research papers. The user can filter this information by category- consumer audio, professional audio, music creation and production.
